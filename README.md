## Batch Node API Client
Node API client wrapper for Batch.com notifications API.

**This client is still WIP**.

This wrapper is greatly inspired from the [unofficial OneSignal Node SDK](https://github.com/SeVeNDuS/node-onesignal-api).

## Installation
This library is distributed on `npm`. In order to add it as a dependency,
run the following command:

``` sh
$ npm install batch-notifications-node --save
```
